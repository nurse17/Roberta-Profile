# Research Project

  The critical heritage surrounding the generic features and impact of detective fiction has most often argued, “that detective fiction of the Victorian era is a literature of reassurance and conformism where structural formulae function to assuage the anxieties and fears of the reader” (Porter 220). However, recent scholarship has shown that Victorian detective fiction is far more than just ‘formulaic’, ‘conservative’ and ‘comforting’ through its analysis of generic transgressions in crime stories both inside and outside the canon. Despite this important, recent work, there has been little consideration of the effects of these notable transgressions on narration and the possibility that narration is as responsible for solving the crime as the forensic evidence provided in the plot. Consequently, the consideration of how new techniques in composition developed out of these transgressions in the detective genre demands further examination. 
  My doctoral dissertation, provisionally entitled “Mind the Gap: Locating the Implied Author between Narrators and the Narrated Text in Victorian Detective Fiction” will examine how these transgressions influence the acts that express the narrator or the intersecting codes and sign systems that comprise the text, from which a reader might go about creating the “implied author” (Lanser). My main research question is, in knowing that implied authorship is clearly a reading effect happening in the course of reading, could the generic categories of suspense and mystery be the “governing consciousness” which influence the reader’s construction of intentionality? My theoretical framework will examine how recent criticism has reestablished the importance of a phenomenological hermeneutics where Genette acknowledges the convergence of two consciousnesses in narration, the authors’ and the readers’. Articulating a consciousness for the subjectivity of the creative voice of the work and the search for principles of coherence, meaning, evidence and the constraints they place on the freedom of interpretation must surpass any author’s intentions and reader’s interpretation. For this reason, I am in agreement with Reshni Dutta-Flanders, who conceives of the development of suspense as having the ability to provoke an intellectual as well as an affective response, shaping our overall outlook of the crime. This dissertation will examine, not the received detective genre of the Victorian Era but the fiction shaped in the process of detection that reflects our encounters and projects our expectations of what we will or will not come to experience.  

# Course Objectives

- I will become familiar with how existing text mining applications, that fall within the scope of my project, are being applied. I will scrutinize whether or not their techniques help analyze the human condition. 

- I will come up with new ways to observe how we think about story.  

- I will come up with relevant questions pertaining to my project, which will make use of existing applications or tools that are currently available. 

- I will become familiar with the utilization of both simple and sophisticated text mining applications.
