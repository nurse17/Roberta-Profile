  This proposal discusses the challenges posed in the digital formalization of spatial information in stories and illustrates the complex tasks undertaken by a digital narratology of space,in Jules Verne's "Around the world in Eighty Days". It is useful in that it outlines very specific problems faced in trying to create a mult-faceted approach to annotating spatial information in the text and even grouped problems into a chain of work tasks,to be solved. What it does well is give a step by step account of the multi-layered method used and shows the strengths of different approaches and how their approach combined those varied advantages into their method of annotation.  It exemplifies digital pedagogy in that it demonstrates the challenges faced in creating techniques for spatial analysis,only to help further the development of the methods already outlined.

  This proposal through a curated combination of bibliographies and machine learning methods,proposes to examine 3500 British travel writing texts,in order to examine and challenge the received literary histories of the genre. It's relevance to my keyword "narration",is that it takes into account the concerns and inevitable changes that went into crafting a balanced personal narrative between the years 1700 and 1830. It not only addresses but provides examples on why and how personal narration,as evidence of experience,was becoming a more important concern than a mere tool for reflection. What it does well is outline specific questions it wishes to ask and offers specific details on how it will go about attempting to answer them. It exemplifies digital pedagogy by sharing it's findings and methodology on varied public forums.
