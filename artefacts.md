This proposal discusses the challenges posed in the digital formalization of spatial information in stories and illustrates the complex tasks undertaken by a digital narratology of space, in Jules Verne's "Around the world in Eighty Days".  It is useful in that it outlines very specific problems faced in trying to create a mult-faceted approach to annotating spatial information in the text and even grouped problems into a chain of work tasks, to be solved.  What it does well is give a step by step account of the multi-layered method used and shows the strengths of different approaches and how their approach combined those varied advantages into their method of annotation.  It exemplifies digital pedagogy in that it demonstrates the challenges faced in creating techniques for spatial analysis, only to help further the development of the methods already outlined.
